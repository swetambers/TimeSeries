    "The residuals have a strong autocorrelation with the ACF jumping outside the confidence intervals for several values of lags. So we would need to take seasonal difference on the residuals. The period of seasonality can be determined based on the fact that the original data is obtained from all quarters of the years and shows seasonality of the quarter. This means that the residuals in quarter one of a year is close in magnitude to the residuals from quarter one of the preceding and succeeding years. This observation makes us take differences over periods of four time units as follows:"
